On the Friday before Christmas, 2025, I searched for meaning.

I opened the Meriam Webster app on my phone and typed in "world weary" and started looking in the synonyms, attempting to find a word that accurately described my inner experience, the exhaustion I felt that wasn't craving sleep or rest, but yearning after a break from my entire existence, of the experience of being chronically fatigued since the spring, of my brain and body slowing, despite my young age of 27. I scrolled through the thesaurus, and my eyes landed on an unfamiliar word, "enervated." The meaning was somewhat generic, "*lacking physical, mental, or moral vigor*," but in the examples I found something that felt much more apt:

> a lifetime of working in dreary jobs had *enervated his very soul*

A little over a year before, I had just started my final year in school. I had finished my Bachelor's in Computer Science the prior spring, and was picking up my masters, of which I'd already taken one third. The masters focused on Cybersecurity, and though my mental health waxed and waned through the fall semester and the first half of the spring, I had some idea of my future. I was going to apply to jobs in cybersecurity, doing my best to stick to some semblance of morality while I entered into a field populated by companies such as Raytheon, or even working directly for the DOD. I choreographed a few contra dances, constructed a couple cryptic crosswords, and generally was treading water and didn't feel like I'd drown anytime soon.

At this point, in Spring 2025, I had managed to avoid catching covid-19, but that streak finally ended in late March. I remember how tired I felt, how I remarked that when I folded my laundry on my bed I had to take a break because it was too much work. Besides the fatigue my experience was pretty mild, like a cold with a lot more fatigue and some lung issues. I got prescribed a steroid for my lungs once I started testing negative, and that brought me, if not all the way to my baseline, to some semblance of normalcy. I was able to dance with lots of rests, and generally continued on with my life – though I did have to drop a particularly difficult and uninteresting class in favor of filling the requirement in the Summer.

Enervated is one of those odd words where you think it might mean energized, but in reality it's the result of losing that very energy.

Late April found me at a folk festival in central Massachusetts, *NEFFA*. I think I had been feeling a bit more tired by this point, but the sense of relative normalcy stuck. That is, until I tried to dance. I had my mask on but quickly had to remove it for oxygen. I danced for eight minutes – the normal length of a contra dance, minus the post and pre-amble. Then found myself absolutely exhausted for the rest of the day. I didn't bother returning to the festival on Sunday.

That day marked the start of long covid, aka post covid syndrom, aka *post-acute sequalae of covid-19* (that's a mouthful... er, typeful? it's something.)
