dumping ground for snippets cut from slow

~~Late April found me at a folk festival in central Massachusetts, *NEFFA*. I think I had been feeling a bit more tired by this point, but the sense of relative normalcy stuck. That is, until I tried to dance. I had my mask on but quickly had to remove it for oxygen. I danced for eight minutes – the normal length of a contra dance, minus the post and pre-amble. Then found myself absolutely exhausted for the rest of the day. I didn't bother returning to the festival on Sunday.

That day marked the start of long covid, aka post covid syndrom, aka *post-acute sequalae of covid-19* (that's a mouthful... er, typeful? it's something.) 

I have an armband now that keeps track of my heart rate, and on a bad day just getting up from sitting and walking down the hall to the bathroom can spike my heart rate to 150bpm or higher. My first few months of long covid (LC) were marked by this exercise intolerance (aka post-exertional malaise, PEM), coupled with tremors, both internal and external. I stopped scheduling anything in the evening because my brain would slow down and all I could really do was watch a screen. In spite of all this, I managed to finish out my final class and get my Master's degree. I was applying to jobs, and though things were hard and large parts of my life were disrupted, I still had some semblance of where I was heading.~~

~~Almost everything that had been keeping me afloat had vanished. I had two kittens I'd adopted on the 2nd of August, some online communities, my family, and a small handful of friends that would keep in touch. But the future suddenly was the most uncertain it's been since I can remember, and not in a wondrous curious way, but rather "will I ever be able to use my brain in the way I once did? Will I ever be able to move my body in the way I once did?" Long covid hasn't been around long enough for anyone on earth to be able to confidently tell me that I'll get better one day. There's some promising research, sure, and  have an appointment at a long covid clinic, but in terms of certainty? nothing is certain.

But nothing is every certain, really. We might think it is, we might think that we'll get a certain job, a certain promotion, find someone to date and marry, move to a particular place, but it's all in up in the air, always. The only thing that's certain in life is it's uncertainness, and death. I don't mean this in a depressive way, though in my darker moments it's easy to view it as such. Life's impermanence gives it meaning – the flower is beautiful not in spite of it's inevitable end, but because of it.~~
