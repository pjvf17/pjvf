## Anagram Clues

Anagram clues work through an *indicator* such as `crazy` or `confused` or `moving` and the *fodder*; the letters to be anagrammed. It's convention held by I believe every cryptic constructor that anagrams are always direct, that is, you're never anagramming the synonym of a word in a clue – you're anagramming the letters in the clue directly.
