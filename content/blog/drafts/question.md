When I was 15 a question coalesced in my mind. I expect that I will spend my whole life answering this question. I don't know what percentage of it I have answered, but I do know that I have a much larger portion of the answer than I did then. The question is:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is it so difficult to do the things that I **know** will make me happy/be good for me, and so difficult to *not* do the things that I know will make me less happy, and less healthy?"

## 1. Why this question?



## 2. Current status of the answer, (?/?% complete)
