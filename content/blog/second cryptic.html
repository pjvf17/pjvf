- Anagram quantity is rather high. One responder told me that for a puzzle of this size, a limit for anagrams, including partials and letter banks, should be around 6-8. (this puzzle had 13 anagrams, and 2 letter banks)
- Frequent use of proper nouns without justification: 1A, 19A, 40A, 17D, 21D, 23D all use proper nouns without it making a whole lot of sense. I was told that if you're using proper nouns, they should generally "correspond to something/someone by specific and in theme with the surface"
- Grid construction caused some issues. 12x12 barred grid leads to a big puzzle, and I had large open sections.
   - Fill was therefore rather constrained, and lead to things like ANTEGG, and STDS
   - Puzzle was unusually easy for it's size. This is due partially to the plethora of anagrams, but the open grid is the other biggest cause.
  
   With these in mind. I'm planning on doing a more normal block grid for my next puzzle.
- Compliments! I did get some positive feedback and want to highlight that, partially just because I think it's a good exercise for myself.
   - 10A, 35A, 31D, 32D, 39D were all highlighted as some of my best clues
   - 41A was highlighted as a good surface
   - Personally, I really enjoy 36D as well
- Final thoughts: Sharing creations is scary! Feedback is scary! I experience this as I start to share more contra choreography, crosswords, and, well, anything new. But it's also really fun to do, and people are really lovely in their feedback, highlighting improvements as well as the current strengths. I'm grateful to how easy it's been to ask for help from crossword constructors, and similarly so with contra choreographers.
- P.S. leave a comment?

I started this puzzle back in mid-February, and worked on it regularly for about a month. I then let it rest until a few days ago, and looked through it one last time. I sent it to a couple people on the Crosscord discord server, and got a bit of feedback. I'll save some of those comments for after the puzzle.

I'll note that there's one clue in here that is a bit nonstandard. I think by nature of this puzzle being fairly easy (partially due to the very open grid, in addition to other reasons), it shouldn't waylay you too much, but click "that one clue" below if you're confused.
