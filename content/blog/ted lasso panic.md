CW: anxiety, panic attacks

I've been rewatching Ted Lasso in the past couple of weeks. If you haven't seen it, it's a delightful show, full of complex characters, laughter, and many profound moments to balance out all the silly ones.

(minor spoiler) at a certain point, a character begins to deal with panic attacks. They talk to a therapist regularly, and it does eventually help. But not once in the whole show are meds mentioned in relation to panic attacks or anxiety. It frustrates me that in covering this topic – something that many people including myself can relate to – they leave out this important possibility of what it can mean to manage panic attacks.

Many people who first get panic attacks aren't going to know what's going on, and might not know that in addition to talk therapy – which can be hugely helpful to work through causes, and get advice on techniques to reduce anxiety and attacks – having medication can do a lot too. A big part of having panic attacks, at least for me, is the fear over having the next one. When I carry panic rescue meds with me, I know that even if a panic attack starts, I have something to calm it down. In addition to acute meds, anxiety can also be treated with regular daily meds such as SSRIs.

I'm not going to recommend anything specific because I'm not a doctor, this is more of a post of "hey, if you're dealing with panic attacks or anxiety, there's meds that can help, ask your doctor"

It's been a while since I've had a full blown panic attack, partially due to better recognition of my anxiety levels, better management of my own selfcare, and having meds that help me. I thought about making this post last time I watched Ted Lasso, but after having a friend go through a panic attack without any meds to help them, I wanted to make this little PSA. Often times you can get a prescription from your Primary Care, and that's a good place to start.
